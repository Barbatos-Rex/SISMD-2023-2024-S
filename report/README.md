# Parallel Digital Image Processing and Analysis

This project explores various parallel processing approaches for image analysis, being sequential-based, multithreaded-based, executor-based, forkJoinPool-based and finally a completableFutures-based implementation. In this document, we'll discuss each approach, provide code snippets, and present benchmark results to compare their performance across different image sizes. In cases where an approach could have other alternatives for implementations, these will also be discussed along with their pros and cons and why we eventually choose the approach we did.
